  Pure DHTML/JavaScript. Capture mouse input, buttons, keystrokes, etc., and actually edit the HTML of the current document. It's not trivial, but possible.
  Create a custom browser plug-in, Java applet, ActiveX control. This would probably be workable, but would take quite a bit of hackery, and may or may not work. Requiring users to install any sort of plugin is very undesirable.
  Imho, limited approach. Only Java applet is (possibly) cross-browser compatible. But not all users have Java on their machines and JavaScript is supported by all popular browsers (well, maybe except text-based, but I think that Java wouldn't work there too)... --Shtriter 07:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
  Users using text based browsers don't matter for WYSIWIG. They are going to be happier editing in Creole --Kevin Holzer (see hlzr.net for contact) 12:38, g29 December 2010 (PST)
  Both Mozilla and Internet Explorer have included ways to make sections of a page editable. IE 5.5 had the MSHTML Editing Platform (archive.org), and Mozilla has its Rich Text Editing API. Both technologies allow Web developers to make parts of a page editable -- in slightly different ways, of course.
  Most current in-browser WYSIWYG editors use the third option.`;
